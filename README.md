## ABSTRACT

### ~ AGRIBOT : 
  The agricultural bot machine learning model collects soil data such as temperature, humidity, moisture, and tilt of land, and uses this information to predict the most optimal crop for those conditions, allowing for more efficient and successful farming practices.   
  Implemented using Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes algorithm.

### ~ FACE RECOGNITION TECNIQUES :
  Linear algebra is essential to various face recognition techniques like SVM, PCA, and CNN. SVM, with its utilization of hyperplanes and kernels, can achieve high accuracies above 90% on small to medium-sized datasets. PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique, can offer good accuracies but might struggle with complex variations in facial images. CNN is a deep learning technique that uses convolutions to extract features and requires large datasets, computational resources.
